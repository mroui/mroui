		Hello! :wave: My name is Martyna and welcome to my GitHub!

		:star2: :sparkles: :star2:
		<br>
		I am fourth year student of Applied Informatics
		<br>
		on specialization „Mobile systems and applications”.
		<br>
		Recently I was working on Engineer's Thesis 
		<br>
		<em>
			"TravelJournal - mobile application which
			<br>
			is an extended equivalent of the paper travel journal".
		</em>
		<br>
		Now I would like to focus on the defense
		<br>
		and training in mobile development.
		<br>
		I am currently working on my <strong>#Java #Android</strong> skills
		<br>
		to get to know <strong>#Kotlin</strong> in the next step.
