		Hello! :wave: My name is Martyna and welcome to my GitHub!
		<br><br>
		:star2: :sparkles: :star2:
		<br>
		I am 1st year, 2nd grade student of Computer Science.
		<br>
		I'm interested in mobile applications and in spare time
		<br>
		I like to explore new technologies unknown to me.
		<br>
		Recently I was working on Engineer's Thesis 
		<br>
		<em>
			"TravelJournal - mobile application which
			<br>
			is an extended equivalent of the paper travel journal".
		</em>
		<br>
		I have defended my work and completed 1st grade studies
		<br>
		and now started 2nd grade at the same University.
		<br>
		Now I would like to focus on my education
		<br>
		and training in mobile development.
		<br>
		I am currently working on my <strong>#Java #Android</strong> skills
		<br>
		to get to know <strong>#Kotlin</strong> in the next step.
